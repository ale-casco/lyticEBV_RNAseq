# lytic_EBV_RNAseq
## Overview
This repository contains the scripts and workflows used in our study on bulk RNA-seq data from FAC-sorted latent, early lytic, and late lytic fractions of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) transformed by a dual-fluorescent lytic reporter Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Our analysis was performed using an Ubuntu Linux environment, utilizing bash for data processing and R for data visualization. 
## Data Availability
Raw and processed RNA-seq data used in this study can be accessed through the NCBI GEO data base under the accession number <to be provided>. The full manuscript detailing our findings is available at <DOI to be provided>.
