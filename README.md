# lytic_EBV_RNAseq
## Overview
This repository contains the scripts and workflows used in our study on bulk RNA-seq data from FAC-sorted latent, early lytic, and late lytic fractions of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) transformed by a dual-fluorescent lytic reporter Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Our analysis was performed using an Ubuntu Linux environment, utilizing bash for data processing and R for data visualization. 
## Data Availability
Raw and processed RNA-seq data used in this study can be accessed through the NCBI GEO data base under the accession number <to be provided>. The full manuscript detailing our findings is available on Cell Reports <insert website>.
## Prerequisites
### Ubuntu Linux
Ensure you have Ubuntu Linnux installed on your system. Processing of the raw data and bash scripts have been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. Bash is required for executing the data processing scripts.
### R and R Packages
This analysis relies on R for data processing and visualization. The R scripts manage dependencies using the **'renv'** package. Please note that the **'renv'** environment was created on a Windows system and may not be fully compatible with Ubuntu or MacOS.
