# lytic_EBV_RNAseq
Description of Ubuntu Linux workflow and bash/R scripts for processing and visualization of bulk RNA-seq data from enriched latent, early lytic, or late lytic fractions of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) transformed by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

Workflow and code used for analysis in "Epstein-Barr virus induces host shutoff extensively via BGLF5-independent mechanisms." A published vesion of this work can be found on Cell Reports: [insert website]

The raw RNA-seq data are available through the NCBI SRA under BioProject accession number PRJNA1088113.
